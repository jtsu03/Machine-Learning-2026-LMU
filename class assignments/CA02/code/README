# 📧 CA02 — Spam Email Classification & Model Evaluation

---

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using a **Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier**.

The assignment demonstrates a complete NLP pipeline:

1. Load raw text emails  
2. Clean and preprocess text  
3. Convert text into numerical features  
4. Train a classifier  
5. Evaluate prediction performance

## 📂 Dataset Structure
```
CA02/
│
├── TRAIN/   -> Training emails
├── TEST/    -> Testing emails

```

Each file represents a single labeled email message.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Read all email files from directories
- Combine lines into a single email body
- Assign labels based on folder location

---

### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
Noise is removed before modeling:

- Lowercase conversion
- Remove punctuation & numbers
- Remove stopwords
- Remove single-character words

---

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering (Bag-of-Words)
A dictionary is built from the most frequent words in the training set.

| Step | Description |
|----|------|
| Build Dictionary | Select most frequent words |
| Count Occurrences | Word frequency per email |
| Feature Matrix | Emails → Numerical vectors |

Rows = Emails  
Columns = Word counts

---

### 4️⃣ Model Training
A **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier is trained.

The algorithm learns probability distributions of words appearing in spam vs non-spam emails.

---

### 5️⃣ Prediction
The trained model predicts labels for unseen emails in the test dataset.

---

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation
Performance is measured using classification metrics:

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|------|
| Accuracy | Overall correctness |
| Precision | Correct spam predictions |
| Recall | Ability to detect spam |
| F1 Score | Balance of precision & recall |
| Confusion Matrix | Detailed prediction breakdown |

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Place dataset folders in the project directory:
```
./TRAIN
./TEST
```

2. Open the notebook
```
CA02.ipynb
```

3. Run all cells sequentially

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text preprocessing
- Stop-word removal
- Bag-of-Words representation
- Naive Bayes classification
- Model evaluation metrics

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Text must be converted to numeric features before modeling
- Feature cleaning strongly impacts performance
- Accuracy alone is insufficient — precision & recall matter
- Confusion matrices provide deeper insight into model behavior
