CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis – House Price Analysis
Overview

This assignment focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on a housing price dataset. The goal is to thoroughly understand the structure, quality, and relationships within the data and prepare it for future machine learning model development. Model building itself is out of scope for this assignment

Dataset

The dataset contains housing attributes that may be predictive of a property's sale price. For this assignment, only the training dataset is used.

Files provided:

house-price-train.csv (used for EDA and data cleaning)

house-price-test.csv (not used in this assignment)

Objectives

The main objectives of this assignment are to:

Understand the structure, domain, and contents of the dataset

Identify and document data quality issues

Apply appropriate data cleaning techniques

Analyze multicollinearity and perform basic feature selection

Assignment Structure
Part 1: Data Understanding

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

Exploratory visualizations

Identification of missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

Creation of a Data Quality Report summarizing identified issues

Part 2: Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing

Handling missing values

Treating outliers

Encoding categorical variables (if applicable)

Ensuring the dataset is analytics-ready

Part 3: Post-Processing (Collinearity Analysis)

Visualization of feature correlations

Identification of highly collinear variables

Recommendation of features to drop, if necessary

Note: Class imbalance analysis is not required for this assignment.
